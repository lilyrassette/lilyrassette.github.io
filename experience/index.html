                <h2>Gene Therapy Automation Start-Up Engineering Intern</h2>
                <p>As an intern at Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, I worked with a team of automation and process engineers on the start-up of a new advanced therapies site in Lebanon, IN. I helped with many projects, including validating new machines and equipment, ensuring they followed GMP, designing adapter PCB boards to make machine implementation smoother, and working with virtual machines and containers. I also worked with an internal consulting team on a variety of engineering projects.</p>

                <h2>Bechtel Innovation Design Center Printing & Prototyping Supervisor</h2>
                <p>As a supervisor at the Bechtel Innovation and Design Center, I mentor and collaborate with hundreds of university students and researchers on projects involving CAD, prototyping, and additive manufacturing. I guide students through the design and fabrication of complex assemblies, leveraging expertise in SLS and SLA 3D printing, laser CNC machining, and material selection to ensure high-quality outcomes. Beyond direct mentorship, as a supervisor I also contribute to the center’s continuous improvement by implementing new equipment, optimizing workflows, and streamlining processes to enhance efficiency and expand the lab’s capabilities.</p>

                <h2>Purdue Solar Racing Low Voltage Lead</h2>
                <p>As the low voltage lead for Purdue Solar Racing, I design and integrate the vehicle’s low-voltage electrical systems, ensuring reliable communication and function. My work includes designing custom PCBs in KiCAD, assmebling and debugging PCBs, implementing sensor interfaces, and developing signal conditioning and power electronics for real-time data acquisition and control. I also perform extensive hardware bring-up, debugging, and validation using oscilloscopes, multimeters, and power analyzers. In addition, I collect and analyze performance data from batteries, solar cells, and power management circuits during lab and field testing to optimize the car’s resilience and efficiency over a 1500+ mile solar endurance race.</p>

                <h2>FIRST Robotics Competition Engineering and Design Lead</h2>
                <p>Through my experience with FIRST Robotics, I gained early hands-on exposure to engineering by designing and building competitive robots under strict time and resource constraints. I contributed to electrical system design, wiring, and programming, while collaborating closely with teammates to solve complex mechanical and control challenges in a fast-paced, team-driven environment.</p>
