    <h1 class="category-page-title">FIRST Robotics Competition - Engineering & Design Lead</h1>
    <p class="category-page-description">
      In high school, I was involved with FIRST Robotics, a competition where students are challenged to design and build a 150lbs robot to complete certain specific tasks, which earn points in a competitive format. I was on team 4982 in the Fort Wayne area, and worked on three seperate robots during my time in high school.

    <!-- SUMMARY SECTION -->
    <div class="summary-section">
      <h2>Design Leadership & System Architecture</h2>
      <p>As Engineering & Design Lead I coordinated subsystem teams (drivebase, manipulator, electrical, controls) to create integrated robot designs that met game-specific requirements and weight/packaging constraints. My role focused on setting design schedules, creating system-level CAD, studying online content, videos, and forums for design inspiration and successful ideas, and ensuring designs were manufacturable within the build season timeline.</p>

    <!-- PROJECT 1 -->

        <img src="chassis_detail.jpg" alt="Chassis CAD and fabrication">
      </div>
      <div class="project-detail-content">
        <h2>Drivebase & Chassis Redesign</h2>
        <p>Led a ground-up redesign of our drivetrain to improve maneuverability and reliability. I evaluated tank vs. swerve vs. mecanum options, selected motors and gearboxes based on torque and current budgets, and produced CAD and manufacturing drawings for the final chassis. We reduced weight while increasing structural stiffness and simplified maintenance access for quick repairs at competitions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Mechanical design, CAD (Fusion 360 / SolidWorks), structural trade studies</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> CNC milling, waterjet, sheet metal, 3D printing</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SUMMARY SECTION -->
    <div class="summary-section">
      <h2>Manipulators, End Effectors & Game Mechanisms</h2>
      <p>I led concept generation and prototyping for gripping, intake, and scoring mechanisms. Rapid prototyping allowed us to iterate quickly on geometry and reliability, and I established testing procedures to validate performance under match conditions.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- PROJECT 2 -->
    <div class="project-detail-item">
      <div class="project-detail-images">
        <img src="frc_photos/robotwork1.JPEG" alt="Intake prototype">

      </div>
      <div class="project-detail-content">
        <h2>Manipulator — From Prototype to Competition</h2>
        <p>Designed and prototyped multiple intake concepts, selected pneumatic and motorized actuators, and developed a lightweight climber that met the endgame scoring requirements. I documented test results, failure modes, and maintenance procedures so the drive team could confidently operate the mechanism during matches.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Rapid prototyping, mechanism kinematics, actuator selection</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Pneumatics, motors (CIM/Falcon/Talon), SolidWorks/Fusion 360/Onshape</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SUMMARY SECTION -->
    <div class="summary-section">
      <h2>Controls, Autonomous & Sensors</h2>
      <p>I collaborated closely with the programming team to integrate sensors and tune control loops for autonomous routines. We used vision processing and encoder-based odometry to achieve accurate scoring during autonomous periods and developed state machines for reliable match-time behavior.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- PROJECT 3 -->
    <div class="project-detail-item">
      <div class="project-detail-content">
        <h2>Autonomous Systems & Vision Integration</h2>
        <p>Worked on sensor selection (Limelight, encoders, IMU), vision-targeting pipelines, and feedforward/feedback tuning in WPILib. I defined interfaces between mech and controls teams so autonomous routines could be tested early and iterated quickly during the season.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Embedded systems integration, PID/Feedforward tuning, vision pipelines</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> WPILib, Limelight, Shuffleboard, Python/OpenCV</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="summary-section">
      <h2>Mentoring, Outreach & Team Processes</h2>
      <p>I mentored new students in CAD, machining, and system-level thinking. I also helped establish build-season workflows (version control for CAD, sprint planning, test harnesses) and ran outreach sessions to recruit new team members and connect with local sponsors.</p>
