    <p class="category-page-description">
      As the Low Voltage Lead on the Purdue Solar Racing team, I am responsible for designing, assembling, and integrating the vehicle's low-voltage electrical systems. This includes custom PCB design, sensor integration, power electronics, and data acquisition systems to ensure optimal performance during the race. Below are some highlights of the projects I have worked on in this role.
    </p>

    <!-- SUMMARY SECTION -->
    <div class="summary-section">
      <h2>CCA Design, Parts Procurment, Assembly, and Testing</h2>
      <p>A large part of the low voltage design of the car is the design and manufacture of various PCB boards to complete tasks such as peripherals, power distribution, and controls. Below are a few boards I helped design, order, and manufacture.</p>
    </div>

      <div class="project-detail-content">
        <h2>Start-Up Board</h2>
        <p>Designed a CCA (circuit card assembly), including schematic capture, part selection, layout, and routing to control the state of the car between fully off, auxiliary (low voltage) battery on, main (high voltage) battery on, and charge mode. The board also includes driver controls like FNR (forward, neutral, and reverse switch), and an emergency stop button. It routes all driver input back to the steering wheel micro controller. In addition to the design portion, I also ordered the PCB and components and assembled this board, tested it, and used it as an example to teach others on the team about CCA design and assembly.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skills: </strong>Parts selection, board procurement, board layout and routing, soldering with stencils.</li>
          <li><strong>Tools: </strong>Altium, KiCad, JLCPCB.</li>

      <h2>Battery Pack Design and Manufacture</h2>
      <p>I helped design and manufacture our previous battery pack for our 2025 car, Lux, as well as our next 2026 car, Artemis. I have gained a lot of experience with pack design and how large lithium ion battery packs function.</p>

        <h2>Pack Design and Assembly</h2>
        <p>Assisted with the design and construction of a 36s8p lithium ion battery pack (133.2 V nominal) and battery protection/management system to power the vehicle. This pack uses 21700 50E cells, 3D printed nylon casing using a FormLabs SLS Fuse 1, laster cut nickel sheets for connection of cells, and thermocouples for monitoring temperature.  </p>
