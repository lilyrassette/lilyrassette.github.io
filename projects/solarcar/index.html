    <h1 class="category-page-title">Purdue Solar Racing - Low Voltage Lead</h1>
    <p class="category-page-description">
      As the Low Voltage Lead on the Purdue Solar Racing team, I am responsible for designing, assembling, and integrating the vehicle's low-voltage electrical systems. This includes custom PCB design, sensor integration, power electronics, and data acquisition systems to ensure optimal performance during the race. Below are some highlights of the projects I have worked on in this role.
    </p>

    <!-- SUMMARY SECTION -->
    <div class="summary-section">
      <h2>PCB Design, Parts Procurment, Assembly, and Testing</h2>
      <p>A large part of the low voltage design of the car is the design and manufacture of various PCB boards to complete tasks such as peripherals, power distribution, and controls. Below are a few boards I helped design, order, and manufacture.</p>

        <h2>3D Printed Wax Casted Ring</h2>
        <p>I taught myself how to use Blender in order to design a custom, personalized ring that I then 3D printed on a Formlabs Form 3B SLA 3D printer out of wax resin. I used the wax model to create a mold for casting the ring in nordic gold, a material commonly used in jewelry making. This project involved multiple steps including 3D modeling, printing, mold making, and metal casting. During the process, I learned more about designing parts for additive manufacturing and lost wax casting. This was a really fun project and I'm very happy with how the ring turned out!</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Lost Wax Casting, 3D Modeling, Additive Manufacturing</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Blender, Fusion360, Formlabs PreForm</li>

      <h2>Mentoring Students & Researchers</h2>
      <p>Throughout my time at BIDC, I've had the privilege of assisting and mentoring numerous students and researchers on their projects. This has included helping them select appropriate materials and fabrication methods, troubleshooting issues with 3D printers and laser cutters, and providing guidance on design for manufacturability. I've worked with a diverse range of projects, from simple prototypes to complex mechanical assemblies, which has broadened my understanding of various engineering disciplines, and sharpened my problem-solving and communication skills. Below are some examples of projects I've significantly contributed to.</p>

        <h2>Projects I've Helped With</h2>
        <p>I have assisted several students and Purdue Formula SAE racing team members in using the BIDC's metal laser cutter for tube coping. This involved training them on the equipment, advising on design considerations, and helping with the setup and operation of the machine. I also helped troubleshoot issues that arose during the cutting process, ensuring successful completion of their projects. This experience enhanced my technical skills and ability to communicate complex information effectively. Some projects I've helped with include custom roll cages, exhaust systems, and structural frames.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Example Projects:</strong> Roll cage parts for Formula SAE, carbon fiber adapters, foldable 3D printed stool, biomedical wearables.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus Areas:</strong> Design for Manufacturability, Team Training, Problem Solving</li>
        </ul>
