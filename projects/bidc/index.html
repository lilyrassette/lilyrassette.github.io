    <p class="category-page-description">
      These are projects I worked on as a Printing & Prototyping Supervisor at the Bechtel Innovation Design Center (BIDC) at Purdue University. My role involves overseeing the use of various fabrication tools, assisting students with their projects, and performing maintenance and lab improvement tasks. Below are some highlights of the projects I contributed to during my time at the BIDC.

    <!-- SUMMARY SECTION -->
    <div class="summary-section">
      <h2>Hands-on Fabrication & Design Leadership</h2>
      <p>In my time at the BIDC, I’ve worked with a wide range of fabrication technologies — from additive manufacturing and laser cutting to metal casting and composite layups. I love creating, troubleshooting, and helping others bring ideas to life.</p>

      <div class="project-detail-content">
        <h2>3D Printed Wax Casted Ring</h2>
        <p>I taught myself how to use Blender in order to design a custom, personalized ring that I then 3D printed on a Formlabs Form 3B SLA 3D printer out of wax resin. I used the wax model to create a mold for casting the ring in nordic gold, a material commonly used in jewelry making. This project involved multiple steps including 3D modeling, printing, mold making, and metal casting. During the process, I learned more about designing parts for additive manufacturing and lost wax casting. This was a really fun project and I'm very happy with how the ring turned out!</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Lost Wax Casting, 3D Modeling, Additive Manufacturing</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Blender, Fusion360, Formlabs PreForm</li>

      <h2>Mentoring Students & Researchers</h2>
      <p>Throughout my time at BIDC, I've had the privilege of assisting and mentoring numerous students and researchers on their projects. This has included helping them select appropriate materials and fabrication methods, troubleshooting issues with 3D printers and laser cutters, and providing guidance on design for manufacturability. I've worked with a diverse range of projects, from simple prototypes to complex mechanical assemblies, which has broadened my understanding of various engineering disciplines, and sharpened my problem-solving and communication skills. Below are some examples of projects I've significantly contributed to.</p>

        <h2>Projects I've Helped With</h2>
        <p>I have assisted several students and Purdue Formula SAE racing team members in using the BIDC's metal laser cutter for tube coping. This involved training them on the equipment, advising on design considerations, and helping with the setup and operation of the machine. I also helped troubleshoot issues that arose during the cutting process, ensuring successful completion of their projects. This experience enhanced my technical skills and ability to communicate complex information effectively. Some projects I've helped with include custom roll cages, exhaust systems, and structural frames.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Example Projects:</strong> Roll cage parts for Formula SAE, carbon fiber adapters, foldable 3D printed stool, biomedical wearables.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus Areas:</strong> Design for Manufacturability, Team Training, Problem Solving</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- SUMMARY SECTION -->
    <div class="summary-section">
      <h2>Maintaining & Improving the Lab</h2>
      <p>As a peer mentor and supervisor at the BIDC, I regularly perform maintenance on various fabrication equipment to ensure they are in optimal working condition. This includes routine cleaning, calibration, and troubleshooting of 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and other tools. I also help with lab improvement tasks, like creating documentation and SOPs and working on projects that make the lab run smoother. </p>

        <h2>Machine Maintenance</h2>
        <p>I've spent a lot of time troubleshooting, problem solving, ordering parts, and fixing machines when they go down! As a result of this, I have become very familiar with how all our equipment functions - I can easily diagnose and replace parts on Bambu Lab, Formlabs, and Markforged printers, as well as our Trotec and Fablight lasers.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Troubleshooting, Machine Maintenance</li>

        <h2>Lab Improvement</h2>
        <p>As a supervisor, part of my responsibility is ensuring that the lab is continuously improved. In addition to keeping documentation of processes and writing SOPs for machinery, I also am constantly working on or thinking of projects that would make the lab better. I have implemented a filtered air system to extend the life of our metal laser cutter, and I have also developed organization systems and signape.</p>
