    <p class="category-page-description">
      These are projects I worked on as a Printing & Prototyping Supervisor at the Bechtel Innovation Design Center (BIDC) at Purdue University. My role involves overseeing the use of various fabrication tools, assisting students with their projects, and performing maintenance and lab improvement tasks. Below are some highlights of the projects I contributed to during my time at the BIDC.

    <!-- SUMMARY SECTION -->
    <div class="summary-section">
      <h2>Hands-on Fabrication & Design Leadership</h2>
      <p>In my time at the BIDC, I’ve worked with a wide range of fabrication technologies — from additive manufacturing and laser cutting to metal casting and composite layups. I love creating, troubleshooting, and helping others bring ideas to life.</p>

        <h2>3D Printed Wax Casted Ring</h2>
        <p>I taught myself how to use Blender in order to design a custom, personalized ring that I then 3D printed on a Formlabs Form 3B SLA 3D printer out of wax resin. I used the wax model to create a mold for casting the ring in nordic gold, a material commonly used in jewelry making. This project involved multiple steps including 3D modeling, printing, mold making, and metal casting. During the process, I learned more about designing parts for additive manufacturing and lost wax casting. This was a really fun project and I'm very happy with how the ring turned out!</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Lost Wax Casting, 3D Modeling, Additive Manufacturing</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Blender, Fusion360, Formlabs PreForm</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mentoring Students & Researchers</h2>
        <p>Throughout my time at BIDC, I've had the privilege of assisting and mentoring numerous students and researchers on their projects. This has included helping them select appropriate materials and fabrication methods, troubleshooting issues with 3D printers and laser cutters, and providing guidance on design for manufacturability. I've worked with a diverse range of projects, from simple prototypes to complex mechanical assemblies, which has broadened my understanding of various engineering disciplines, and sharpened my problem-solving and communication skills. Below are some examples of projects I've significantly contributed to.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Example Projects:</strong> Roll cage parts for Formula SAE, carbon fiber adapters, foldable 3D printed stool, biomedical wearables.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus Areas:</strong> Design for Manufacturability, Team Training, Problem Solving</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="summary-section">
      <h2>Maintaining & Improving the Lab</h2>
      <p>As a supervisor, I not only support students but also keep the lab running smoothly — performing maintenance on printers, CNCs, and lasers, and leading upgrades that make the space safer and more efficient.</p>

        <h2>Machine Maintenance & Lab Improvements</h2>
        <p>I’ve overhauled printer calibration routines, replaced parts on CNC gantries, and implemented a filtered air system for our metal laser cutter. These improvements reduced downtime and improved air quality, contributing to a better work environment.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Troubleshooting, Machine Maintenance, Systems Improvement</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> CNC, Metal Laser Cutter, 3D Printers</li>
