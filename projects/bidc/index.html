        <p class="category-page-description">
            These are projects I worked on as the Printing & Prototyping Supervisor at the Bechtel Innovation Design Center (BIDC) at Purdue University. My role involved overseeing the use of various fabrication tools, assisting students with their projects, and ensuring safety protocols were followed. Below are some highlights of the projects I contributed to during my so far time at the BIDC.

                <h2>3D Printed Wax Casted Ring</h2>
                <p>
                    I taught myself how to use Blender in order to design a custom, personalized ring that I then 3D printed on a Formlabs Form 3B SLA 3D printer out of wax resin. I used the wax model to create a mold for casting the ring in nordic gold, a material commonly used in jewelry making. This project involved multiple steps including 3D modeling, printing, mold making, and metal casting. During the process, I learned more about designing parts for additive manufacturing and lost wax casting. This was a really fun project and I'm very happy with how the ring turned out!

                <h2>Mentoring Students and Researchers</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout my time at BIDC, I've had the privilege of assisting and mentoring numerous students and researchers on their projects. This has included helping them select appropriate materials and fabrication methods, troubleshooting issues with 3D printers and laser cutters, and providing guidance on design for manufacturability. I've worked with a diverse range of projects, from simple prototypes to complex mechanical assemblies, which has broadened my understanding of various engineering disciplines, and sharped my problem-solving and communication skills. Below are some examples of projects I've significantly contributed to.

    <h3>Custom 3D Printed Prosthetic</h3>
    <p>
      I assisted a student in designing and fabricating a custom prosthetic hand using our 3D printers. We worked together to select the right materials and optimize the design for strength and flexibility. The project required troubleshooting printer issues and refining the model for a perfect fit. Seeing the final product in use was incredibly rewarding.

    <h3>Laser Cut Gearbox Prototype</h3>
    <p>
      I helped a research team develop a prototype gearbox using laser-cut acrylic components. My role included advising on design for manufacturability and ensuring precise tolerances. The project involved several iterations and hands-on assembly, which improved my understanding of mechanical systems. The final prototype was used for further testing and presentations.

    <h3>Student Design Consultation</h3>
    <p>
      I regularly provided design consultations for students working on capstone projects. This included material selection, fabrication method recommendations, and guidance on assembly techniques. These interactions strengthened my communication skills and broadened my exposure to diverse engineering challenges. Many students credited my support for the success of their projects.
